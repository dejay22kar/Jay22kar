Lets talk about the elephant in the room first - what's a number doing in my name. Well, my last name is Baviskar. 'Bavis' in my mothertongue (Marathi) means 22. Hence Baviskar = 22kar. 

I remember I came up with it when I was a kid and it felt veryy creative (at that time it did xO) and then it got stuck with me like a tattoo. And yes, I abso-fucking-lutely hate it whenever I try making my account on a new website and cannot use _jay22kar_ as my username, like who in the world has exactly the same name as mine and is as stupidly obsessed as me with such a username -_-

## How am I doing?

    I look the better from the left side rather than right, and I look the best at an angle of 45 degrees from the front.

And this is my paragraph. 
Kinda fun.
